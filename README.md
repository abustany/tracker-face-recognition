# Tracker Face Miner

Use the [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) API to
detect and recognize faces in pictures indexed by
[Tracker](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Tracker/).

## Done

- [x] Detect faces in pictures and store regions of interest (ROIs) in Tracker
- [x] Simple GUI to put names on Faces
- [x] Store ROIs to contact associations in Tracker

## TODO

- [ ] Better face assignment GUI
- [ ] Behave as a proper miner (react to files being inserted in the index etc.)
